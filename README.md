# Human_Following_Robot


## ðŸš— Object-Following Robotic Car (Arduino-Based)

This is a self-led Arduino project where I designed and built a robotic car capable of detecting and following objects in its path. The car uses a combination of ultrasonic and IR sensors to track the position of nearby objects and adjust its movement accordingly.

### ðŸ”§ Components Used

 Arduino Uno
 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
 2 Ã— IR Sensors
 4 Ã— Gear Motors
 L293D Motor Driver Shield
 1 Ã— Servo Motor
 2 Ã— 3.7V 18650 Li-ion Batteries (for power supply)

### ðŸ§  Key Features

 Object Detection & Following: Uses ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and follow moving objects within range.
 Directional Control: Mounted servo rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan surroundings.
 Obstacle Avoidance Assistance: IR sensors help in maintaining direction and avoiding close-range side obstacles.
 Compact Power Supply: Powered by two rechargeable 18650 Li-ion cells for portability and efficiency.

This project was built as a hands-on exercise in embedded systems and robotics using Arduino.
